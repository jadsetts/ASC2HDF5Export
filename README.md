# ASC2HDF5Export

This code was made in conjuction with Danny Chhin while I was employed at Prof. Janine Mauzeroll's lab at McGill University as a postdoctoral researcher.

Takes in HEKA notebook and trace ASC data exports and returns an HDF5 file with notebook variables stored as attributes and arrays stored as datasets. This code will be used in combination with database storage and metadata exporting from users.
